lwn note: https://lwn.net/Articles/762264/

bzip.org apparently expired. oops. this is a source mirror of bzip2 1.0.6.

https://sourceware.org/bzip2/ was the once and future home of bzip2.

will probably archive this as soon as it's been updated with the latest code/archive.

original bzip2-1.0.6.tar.gz (sha256sum a2848f34fcd5d6cf47def00461fcb528a0484d8edef8208d6d2e2909dc61d9cd) is at: https://github.com/ryanwoodsmall/bzip2/releases/download/1.0.6/bzip2-1.0.6.tar.gz
